        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>I've enjoyed reading for a very long time. I mostly just read science and philosphy books based purely on interest. I'll read a novel ever once in a while, but it has to be very good and highly recomended.</p>

        <h2>Jiu Jitsu</h2>
        <p>I've done Jiu Jitsu for about a year and half. I recently moved and am exploring for another gym to train at. Jiu Jitsu, specifcially Brazillian Jiu Jitsu is a Martial Art that utilizes grappling for both self defence and sport application.</p>
